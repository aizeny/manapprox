# manapprox - Non-Parametric Estimation of Manifolds from Noisy Data
The code in the package implements algorithms from the papers:
1) Y. Aizenbud and B. Sober "Non-Parametric Estimation of Manifolds from Noisy Data." arXiv:2105.04754
2) B. Sober and D. Levin. "Manifold Approximation by Moving Least-Squares Projection (MMLS)." Journal of Constructive Approximation. arXiv:1606.07104
3) B. Sober,Y. Aizenbud, and D. Levin. "Approximation of functions over manifolds: A moving least-squares approach." Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics arxiv:1711.00765

If you are using this code our only request is that you cite these papers.
This is still a beta-version and we are happy to assist in case you encounter any problems.
